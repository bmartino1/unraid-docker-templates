- **Virtual File System:** Share even a single file, with a different name if needed, without touching the real file.
- **Customizable:** Present things the way you want!
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Watch all activities in real-time.
- **Bandwidth Control:** Decide how much bandwidth to allocate.
- **Direct Sharing:** Share large files with friends without uploading them to a server.
- **Intelligent Problem Detection:** HFS tries to detect problems and suggest solutions.
- **Expandable:** Find the right plugin, or create your own.
