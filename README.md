HFS ~ HTTP File Server by Rejetto

Access via web your files directly from your disk
You be the server! Share files fresh from your disk, with unlimited space and bandwidth.
Fast! Try zipping 100GB, downloads starts immediately!
Share even a single file with our virtual file system, even with a different name, all without touching the real file. Present things the way you want!
Watch all activities in real-time.
Control bandwidth: decide how much to give.
No intermediaries: give a huge file to your friend without waiting for it to be uploaded on a server first.
Intelligent: HFS tries to detect problems and suggest solutions.
Expandable: find the right plugin, or make you own.
